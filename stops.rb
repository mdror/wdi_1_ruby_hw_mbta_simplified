# Program gives the correct distance in edge cases (e.g. route starts and
# ends at the same stop, route starts or ends at Park Street)
# Stops and lines can be added, removed, or rearranged in your
# code without making any changes to the route-finding logic
# (within reason â€“ every line must intersect at a single common stop)
# Repository has several logical commits with descriptive messages
# Code uses correct indentation/style and descriptive variable names

#Gets input for first line
puts "What line did you get on?"

#Gets input for first stop
# puts "What stop did you get on?"
